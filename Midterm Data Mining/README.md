 # Intrusion Detection System for CAN Bus Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project focuses on developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for vehicular Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus systems. Using advanced machine learning techniques, the system classifies and identifies various types of cyberattacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Spoofing attacks. The project employs Random Forest and Tree Ensemble methods to ensure accurate and scalable threat detection.

## Features
- Preprocessing of CAN Bus datasets, including handling missing values, converting hexadecimal data to binary and decimal formats.
- Classification of benign and attack traffic using machine learning models.
- Multi-level classification for specific attack types (e.g., GAS Spoofing, SPEED Spoofing, DoS).
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
